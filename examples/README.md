# Examples
Hi! Thanks for checking out this project.
I hope that one day, Elm will allow me to package these terminal emulators with websockets, so that you can immediately connect to a websocket server and be on with your day.

If that's what you're interested in, check out [ws-term](https://github.com/wsowens/wsterm).

Otherwise, let's play with some examples.

To look at the examples below in this folder, you'll need to download this repo and setup Elm.
Once you do that, navigate to the directory and simply run `elm reactor`.
```
cd examples
elm reactor
```
