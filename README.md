# elm-term
An Elm package for working with ANSI-encoded colors and formatting.
Because Elm 19.0 does not allow any way for packages to interact with Websockets, I'm afraid I must deliver this terminal with some assembly required.

If you want a terminal that works right out of the box, see [add link to working github example]

## Installation / Getting Started
Simply run the following command to add this package to your project:
```
elm install wsowens/term
```
You can then import the file into your project like so:
```elm
import Term
```

## Documentation
I recommend looking at the examples on (GitHub)[insert link].

You can find the API documentation on (Elm's website)[https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/wsowens/term/latest].
